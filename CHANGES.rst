``BTrees`` Changelog
====================

4.3.0 (TBD)
-----------

- Fix unexpected ``OverflowError`` when passing 64bit values to long
  keys / values on Win64.  See:
  https://github.com/zopefoundation/BTrees/issues/32

- When testing ``PURE_PYTHON`` environments under ``tox``, avoid poisoning
  the user's global wheel cache.

- Drop support for Python 2.6 and 3.2.

- The pure-Python implementation, used on PyPy and when a C compiler
  isn't available for CPython, now pickles identically to the C
  version. Unpickling will choose the best available implementation.
  This prevents interoperability problems and database corruption if
  both implementations are in use. While it is no longer possible to
  pickle a Python implementation and have it unpickle to the Python
  implementation if the C implementation is available, existing Python
  pickles will still unpickle to the Python implementation (until
  pickled again). See:
  https://github.com/zopefoundation/BTrees/issues/19

- Unpickling empty BTrees in a pure-Python environment no longer
  creates invalid objects that fail with ``AttributeError``.

4.2.0 (2015-11-13)
------------------

- Add support for Python 3.5.

4.1.4 (2015-06-02)
------------------

- Ensure that pure-Python Bucket and Set objects have a human readable
  ``__repr__`` like the C versions.

4.1.3 (2015-05-19)
------------------

- Fix ``_p_changed`` when removing items from small pure-Python
  BTrees/TreeSets and when adding items to small pure-Python Sets. See:
  https://github.com/zopefoundation/BTrees/issues/13


4.1.2 (2015-04-07)
------------------

- Suppress testing 64-bit values in OLBTrees on 32 bit machines.
  See:  https://github.com/zopefoundation/BTrees/issues/9

- Fix ``_p_changed`` when adding items to small pure-Python
  BTrees/TreeSets. See:
  https://github.com/zopefoundation/BTrees/issues/11


4.1.1 (2014-12-27)
------------------

- Accomodate long values in pure-Python OLBTrees.


4.1.0 (2014-12-26)
------------------

- Add support for PyPy and PyPy3.

- Add support for Python 3.4.

- BTree subclasses can define ``max_leaf_size`` or ``max_internal_size``
  to control maximum sizes for Bucket/Set and BTree/TreeSet nodes.

- Detect integer overflow on 32-bit machines correctly under Python 3.

- Update pure-Python and C trees / sets to accept explicit None to indicate
  max / min value for ``minKey``, ``maxKey``.  (PR #3)

- Update pure-Python trees / sets to accept explicit None to indicate
  open ranges for ``keys``, ``values``, ``items``.  (PR #3)


4.0.8 (2013-05-25)
------------------

- Fix value-based comparison for objects under Py3k:  addresses invalid
  merges of ``[OLI]OBTrees/OBuckets``.

- Ensure that pure-Python implementation of ``OOBTree.byValue`` matches
  semantics (reversed-sort) of C implementation.


4.0.7 (2013-05-22)
------------------

- Issue #2:  compilation error on 32-bit mode of OS/X.

- Test ``PURE_PYTHON`` environment variable support:  if set, the C
  extensions will not be built, imported, or tested.


4.0.6 (2013-05-14)
------------------

- Changed the ``ZODB`` extra to require only the real ``ZODB`` package,
  rather than the ``ZODB3`` metapackage:  depending on the version used,
  the metapackage could pull in stale versions of **this** package and
  ``persistent``.

- Fixed Python version check in ``setup.py``.


4.0.5 (2013-01-15)
------------------

- Fit the ``repr`` of bucket objects, which could contain garbage
  characters.


4.0.4 (2013-01-12)
------------------

- Emulate the (private) iterators used by the C extension modules from
  pure Python.  This change is "cosmetic" only:  it prevents the ZCML
  ``zope.app.security:permission.zcml`` from failing.  The emulated
  classes are **not** functional, and should be considered implementation
  details.

- Accomodate buildout to the fact that we no longer bundle a copy
  of 'persistent.h'.

- Fix test failures on Windows:  no longer rely on overflows from
  ``sys.maxint``.


4.0.3 (2013-01-04)
------------------

- Added ``setup_requires==['persistent']``.


4.0.2 (2013-01-03)
------------------

- Updated Trove classifiers.

- Added explicit support for Python 3.2, Python 3.3, and PyPy.
  Note that the C extensions are not (yet) available on PyPy.

- Python reference implementations now tested separately from the C
  verions on all platforms.

- 100% unit test coverage.


4.0.1 (2012-10-21)
------------------

- Provide local fallback for persistent C header inclusion if the
  persistent distribution isn't installed. This makes the winbot happy.


4.0.0 (2012-10-20)
------------------

Platform Changes
################

- Dropped support for Python < 2.6.

- Factored ``BTrees`` as a separate distribution.

Testing Changes
###############

- All covered platforms tested under ``tox``.

- Added support for continuous integration using ``tox`` and ``jenkins``.

- Added ``setup.py dev`` alias (installs ``nose`` and ``coverage``).

- Dropped dependency on ``zope.testing`` / ``zope.testrunner``:  tests now
  run with ``setup.py test``.

Documentation Changes
#####################

- Added API reference, generated via Spinx' autodoc.

- Added Sphinx documentation based on ZODB Guide (snippets are exercised
  via 'tox').

- Added ``setup.py docs`` alias (installs ``Sphinx`` and
  ``repoze.sphinx.autointerface``).
